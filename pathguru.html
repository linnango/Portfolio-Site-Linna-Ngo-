    <h3> Project 1: Pathguru </h3>
    <p>
      Pathguru is a platform to help users connect to professionals in various industries in order to help project them towards the career-path they want to follow.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <h4> Objective </h4>
   <p>Create a competitive response web app that introduces a solution to an audience that is not being currently served well in the market. This will be measured by user tests and surveys and is to be delivered within 6 months of the project start date.
   </p>
 </div>
 <div class="col-md-6">
  <h4> Problem Statement </h4>
   <p>“Young students and adults need a way to connect and network with professionals in industries they are interested in joining because it will help them to achieve their career goals.
       We will know this to be true when we see that the app is successfully connecting them to professionals they seek while providing them useful information on what they want to learn.”
   </p>

  <h4>My Process</h4>
   <p>
    Research: A competitive analysis was done on LinkedIn, including their market profile and SWOT analysis since their business objective closely relates to PathGuru. I identified what solutions exist, what’s working for others in the market and where I might be able to improve it.
   </p>

   <p>
    Ideation: User stories were conceived to help identify the fundamental requirements of the project in order for it to be usable.
   </p>

   <p>
    User story 1: As a new user, I want to be walked through the features of this foreign app, so I know what its purpose is.
   </p>

   <p>
     User story 2: As a user seeking career advice, I want to be able to browse the app for relevant information about industries I’m interested in.
   </p>
   <p>
   User personas were created after several user interviews in order to show who our typical user would be and user journeys to show how their goals would be achieved through our designs.
